# Babbage
bankonmeOS source code builder version 2
It has been decided that each and every release of the bankonmeOS developer edition will proceed along the alphabet using the last name of famous philospers in the release title. Charles Babbage did his part to make the mechanical computer a reality. Of course I learned a little more about bash this round... and added the first if then statement for user interaction. I am about to test this out on a fresh install of Ubuntu 16.04LTS. The bankonmeOS project goal is simple... to protect cryptocurrency from malice. I shortened the name of the file and might regret this later. Likely will have to date stamp the file for future releases. For now... version two is released in the raw with the added bonus of including Zcash and Bitsquare. Bitsquare is improving. You can bankon.me
I am releasing what may be the first .mag file into the wild.
*.mag files are an extension released under the MIT license.
*.mag (c) Gregory L. Magnusson
I used to program PHP in .mag files.... then I found bash.
to install you still have to use the command line

$ chmod +x bankonme.mag
$ sudo ./bankonme.mag

I am working on the permissions and am not a fan of blasting this whole thing in as root. However, this is the developer edition. If you have a ton of cryptocurreny you need a computer that is NOT connected to the Internet and create a paper wallet and put that paper in a safe. Lose the passphrase lose the money. I am proving that as I chase down 3 Zcash that I picked up in the early days. Really!!! Web Wallets are not safe and two mining companies have screwed me so far.

Have fun out there... this build takes a while and requires a 64 bit machine, 2 gig of ram (at least) and 200 gigs of space to be safe. The blockchains are growing along the lines of Moore's law. Pure genius is in the code.
